  - name: order_item
    description: >
      Contains data about the items included in each order.
      Each row represents a single product purchased within an order, including
      its shipping deadline (`shipping_limit_date`), product price, and
      associated freight cost.
      An order can include multiple items (even multiple units of the same
      product), each having individual price and freight allocations.
  
      This table enforces referential integrity to the `order`, `product`, and
      `seller` tables and removes records with FK inconsistencies, negative
      values, or composite primary key violations.
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        description: Unique identifier of the order (FK to stg.order).
