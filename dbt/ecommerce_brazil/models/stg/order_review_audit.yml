      This table contains customer satisfaction reviews submitted after the
      delivery of an order or once the estimated delivery date has passed.
      After completing a purchase on the Olist Store, customers are prompted
      via email to provide feedback about their shopping experience. They can 
      assign a score between 1 and 5 and optionally include a comment title and
      message.
      This model standardizes, validates, and filters out reviews with missing
      or inconsistent data, ensuring quality inputs for customer satisfaction
      analytics.
