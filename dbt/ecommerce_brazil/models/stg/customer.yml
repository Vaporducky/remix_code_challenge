      This staging table contains cleaned and validated customer records,
      including location information such as city, state, and zip code. Each 
      record represents a customer associated with an order in the order table.
      While the `customer_id` is unique per order, the `customer_master_id` 
      allows tracking repurchases by linking different `customer_id`s back to
      the same underlying customer identity.

      This table is primarily used to:
        - Join with the orders dataset to enrich each order with customer and
          geographic data.
        - Enable customer-level analysis, such as retention and frequency of
          repurchase.
        - Perform geographic segmentation and delivery analysis.
      
      Staged customer. Normalized and cleaned version of raw customer records.
      Drops customers that have:
        - missing critical fields (IDs, state, zip)
        - invalid zip format
        - no matching geolocation zip code (foreign key integrity)
        - duplicate customer_id values

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Each order has a unique customer_id (PK).
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: customer_master_id
        description: >
          Master-level ID that represents the actual user across multiple accounts or addresses.
          Not unique; multiple customer_id values can map to the same master_id.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: customer_zip_code_prefix
        description: First 5 digits of the customer's zip code. FK to the geolocation table.
        tests:
